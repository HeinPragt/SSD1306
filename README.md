# SSD1306
This is an Arduino library for Monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers
It supports the 128 x 64 and the 64 x 48 displays
You can also configure the orientation of the display
To coonfigure the displaytype and orention just change the defines
in the top of this file for the memory buffer.
Using this type of display will cost a lot of memory for the buffer
